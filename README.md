# Wireless-Scoring-Board

In Firmenich, there is a blind panel where blind employees to help researchers analyze the components of products. 
Blind employees will give the scores of various attributes of the products, 
But we need a lot of assistants to do data collection
because they are not able to use electronic devices.
But the whole data collection process is error-prone and inefficient.<br/>
<br/>
We designed a wireless scoring board that is easier for blind employee to 
give ratings and send the data to a host computer, 
which makes the whole process more accurate and efficient. 

Please refer to slides and report for more details.
